\chapter*{Abstract}

The postmerger phase of binary neutron star(BNS) coalescences is widely studied in the context of gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. Numerical relativity(NR) simulations have shown that gravitational waves(GWs) and electromagnetic signatures during this late phase are complex and highly dependent on the equation of state of supranuclear matter. This thesis addresses one of the main problems in modeled searches of BNS postmerger gravitational waves: existing models require a high-dimensional parameter space. Several simple models are overlapped against a set of 220 numerical relativity BNS waveforms at 100MPc using the matched filtering algorithm. We find that for postmerger GW signals generated by equal-mass non-spinning binaries, a finite monochromatic model can recover 60-80\% of the optimal signal-to-noise-ratio(SNR) while closely recovering the waveform's duration and main frequency $f_2$. Similar amounts of SNR can be recovered for other waveforms, but the duration and frequency recovery is very poor. Further, the finite monochromatic model with constant amplitude is modified by including zero-crossing amplitude envelopes, improving the duration and frequency recovery but introducing only marginal changes to the SNR recovery.
