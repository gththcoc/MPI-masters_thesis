\chapter{Results}\label{res}

The following chapter summarizes the results obtained by overlapping simple closed form template models with each of the 200 waveforms present in the catalogs introduced in section \ref{NR}. Furthermore, the parameters that maximize the SNR recovery for a given model will be extracted for different purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a finite monochromatic model with constant amplitude, find out which BNS postmerger waveform could be detectable at 100MPc using the matched filtering algorithm.

\item In the case of detectable postmerger sources, examine how well the model recovers waveform features like its main frequency and duration.

\item Check whether modeling the postmerger's first amplitude minimum (see figure \ref{}) with zero crossing amplitude envelopes can improve the SNR and parameter recovery for some waveforms in the catalog.

\end{enumerate}


To complete this task, the code described in section \ref{} will be generalized for j=220 waveforms $h^j$ and templates with n-free parameters $q$. Since one can map a unique template $q$ to each point in the parameter space represented by the n-tuple $(a_1,...,a_n)$, template models will from now on be interpreted in geometrical terms as an n-dimensional object called \textit{template bank}. 

\begin{equation}\label{ndim}
q_{_{a_1,...,a_n}}(t)
\end{equation}

Such an n-dimensional template bank will be used to compute its inner products \ref{} with each signal $h^j$, such that the SNR in an n-dimensional grid can be written as 

\begin{equation}\label{pul}
\rho^j_{_{_{a_1,...,a_n}}} = \frac{\langle h^j, q_{_{_{a_1,...,a_n}}}\cdot e^{i(2\pi \tau+\phi)}\rangle \bigg\rvert_{\phi =\phi_{opt},\tau =\tau_{max}}}{\sqrt{\langle  q_{_{_{a_1,...,a_n}}},q_{_{_{a_1,...,a_n}}} \rangle}}
\end{equation}


Of which the global maximum and its location in parameter space $a_{1_{best}},...,a_{n_{best}}$ will be extracted 

\begin{equation}
\rho_{max} = \rho_{_{a_{1_{best}},...,a_{n_{best}},\phi_{opt},\tau_{max}}}
\end{equation}

Where $\phi_{opt},\tau_{max}$ are the optimal phase and timeshift extracted to reconstruct the signal in the time domain as shown in figure \ref{fig:7}. 

During the development of this thesis, a Python code that provides an interface to compute waveform strain, generate simple template banks, and run the matched filtering algorithm iteratively on one or more catalogs of NR waveforms was implemented. The following flowchart shows its infrastructure and outlines the technical difficulties encountered when dealing with sets of waveforms that use different file formats, resolutions, unit systems for physical observables, and missing metadata.

\section{The 2-dimensional finite monochromatic model}\label{2dsearch}

The following section will consider a template model that only accounts for the most dominant frequency and duration of a BNS postmerger GW. Hence, it will be constructed by using a sinusoidal wave with constant amplitude and frequency and a rectangular window to define its finite duration 

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:19}
%q_{_{_{A, f, \phi_0, t_{0}, d}}}(t) =A \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_0) \cdot \Pi_{t_{0},t_{0} + d}(t)=
%\begin{cases} 
%      0 & t<t_{0} \\
%      A \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_0) & t_{0} \leq t\leq t_{0}+d \\
%      0 & t>t_{0}+d
%   \end{cases}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:19}
q_{_{_{A, f, \phi_0, t_{0}, d}}}(t) =A \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_0) \cdot \Pi_{t_{0},t_{0} + d}(t)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}\label{eq:18}
\Pi_{_{_{a,b}}}(t) = \theta(t-a)-\theta(t-b) = 
\begin{cases} 
      0 & a<t \\
      1 & a \leq t\leq b \\
      0 & b>t
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $t_0$ is wave starting time, $t_0+d$ and $f$ its duration and frequency, and $A$ and $\phi$ its amplitude and phase.


As seen in section \ref{}, matched filtering algorithm allows us to find the optimal values for amplitude, phase, and timeshift $A_{opt}$, $\phi_{opt}$ and $t_{0_{opt}}$, such that the template model \ref{eq:19}, can be written as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
q_{_{_{f,d}}}(t) =
\begin{cases} 
      0 & t<t_{0_{opt}} \\
      A_{opt} \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_{0_{opt}}) & t_{0_{opt}} \leq t\leq t_{0_{opt}}+d \\
      0 & t>t_{0_{opt}}+d
   \end{cases}
%\label{eq_uk}.
\end{equation}

The recovered SNR equation \ref{pul} can be written in terms of the 2-dimensional bank of templates \ref{eq:20}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
\rho_{rec} := \rho_{_{_{f,d}}} = \frac{\langle h, q_{_{_{f,d}}}\cdot e^{i(2\pi \tau+\phi)}\rangle \bigg\rvert_{\phi =\phi_{opt},\tau =\tau_{max}}}{\sqrt{\langle  q_{_{_{f,d}}},q_{_{_{f,d}}} \rangle}}
\end{equation}


For the sake of simplicity, in this thesis, template banks will be constructed in a uniform rectangular grid of 200 by 200 points, where the $f$-dimension varies from 500 to 3500 Hz, and the duration dimension varies between 0.1 milliseconds and $1.5 \cdot d_{postm}$.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

%However, notice that different algorithms address the problem of building template banks optimally, which is beyond the scope of what is presented here\cite{Allen_2021}.

Subsequently, the 2D recovered SNR \ref{eq:21} , normalized by the optimal SNR \ref{sopt}, will be computed at each point of the grid and will be represented as the third dimension using colormaps. 


The following figure shows how a \textit{Non-spinning equal mass BNS systems} may generate a signal with slow amplitude and frequency variations. Overlapping such waveform against the template model \ref{} produces a colormap where two main regions show SNR peaks: the first between 1.5-2 kHz below 5 ms and the second between 2-2.5 kHz with a peak at 15ms.

%In this example, the postmerger tail has a high amplitude and a slowly varying frequency which helps the monochromatic model \ref{} recover a long duration without losing SNR due to misalignments with the waveform. 

Below, a few other example waveforms will be overlapped against the template model \ref{} to depict how the matched filtering algorithm can, for other more complex BNS postmerger signals, recover more SNR with short monochromatic segments instead.
 

\textit{High mass ratio BNS systems}, i.e. $q=m_1/m_2>1.6$ may show also 2 regions with excess SNR recovery. However, the low frequency-low duration region of parameter space dominates.

\newpage

\textit{Spinning BNS systems} i.e. $\chi_{eff}>0.2$(see equation \ref{chieff}) have a more complex frequency evolution. The colormap shows two regions of SNR excess: a wide one ranging from 1-2.5 kHz and duration below 5ms, and the other between 3-3.5 kHz with a peak duration around half waveform's duration $d_{postm}$. Notice that both regions have similar amounts of SNR recovery, so even though this example waveform prefers a long high frequency monochromatic segment, in some other cases, it may be a short, low frequency one.

Since eccentric, high mass ratio, or spinning BNS systems may generate waveforms that are a challenging task for the monochromatic model \ref{}. We can avoid searching in the low frequency region with a different question that slightly modifies the target of the search:

Original question$\rightarrow$" Which parameters f and d would produce the monochromatic wave that recovers most of the signal-to-noise ratio?"

New question$\rightarrow$" Which parameters f and d would produce the monochromatic wave that recovers most of the signal-to-noise ratio that contains more than n oscillations?"


Modifying the question in such a way would increase the number of rejected points lying on the orange region(see figure\ref{fig:11}) and get rid of the loud low-frequency structure dominating the colormaps \ref{}, which is related to oscillations right after $t_{merg}$.

Even though imposing such constraints on parameter space might help to recover the template frequency and duration, using such a method in real GW searches seems unfeasible as the start of a GW signal in the datastream is unknown, and its duration as well.

\section{How well can the monochromatic model recover signals in the catalog?}

The fact that one can find waveforms in the catalogs for which the finite monochormatic model can reproduce its duration and main frequency while at the same time recovering more than 75\%  of the optimal SNR(see figure \ref{BAM:0035}) leads us to ask wheter such a simple model can produce similar results across the whole waveform catalog. 
 
This section will use the infrastructure described in figure \ref{} to analize iteratively the whole dataset of 220 wavefoms(see section \ref{}) using the finite monochromatic template model \ref{}. In that case, equation \ref{} for computing the maximum recovered SNR takes the form 


\begin{equation}\label{eq:21}
\rho_{_{_{rec}}} = \rho^j_{_{_{f,d}}} = \frac{\langle h^j, q_{_{_{f,d}}}\cdot e^{i(2\pi \tau+\phi)}\rangle \bigg\rvert_{\phi =\phi_{opt},\tau =\tau_{max}}}{\sqrt{\langle  q_{_{_{f,d}}},q_{_{_{f,d}}} \rangle}}
\end{equation}



Let $f_{best}$ and $d_{best}$ be the parameters of the monochormatic templates that recovers the maximum SNR $\rho_{_{_{rec}}}$ for a given waveform $h^j$ in the catalog. Several other quatities will be used to characterize the waveform dataset and its best matching monochormatic template in terms of signal properties like $d_{wei}$, $f_{wei}$, and physical observables like $M=m_1+m_2$, $q=m_1/m_2$ and $\chi_{_{eff}}$\ref{}.


Moreover, the following 2D plane will be used to combine the optimal SNR $\rho_{_{_{opt}}}$ and the ratio $\alpha=\rho_{_{_{rec}}}/\rho_{_{_{opt}}}$ to characterize the whole waveform dataset according to the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}

\item Waveform detectability at 100 MPc, given an optimal SNR threshold of 8, which is picked according to third-generation detector sensitivity and population studies like \cite[section 3]{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2109.09882}

\item SNR recovery using the monochormatic model.

Where the color coding in the previous plot, will be key to separate subgroups of waveforms that lie in the four different corners of the diagram

\begin{itemize}
\item Upper left: signals that could be detected at 100 MPc, but the monochromatic model leaves a considerable margin of improvement.
\item Lower left: signals that would not be detected at 100 MPc, nor the monochromatic, represent a good model for them.
\item 
Upper right: possibly detectable waveforms at 100MPc that require simple modeling.
\item 
Lower right: non-detectable waveforms at 100MPc that require simple modeling.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, such color coding will be extended to histograms of quantities like $d_{wei}$, $f_{wei}$, $\delta=M/M_{TOV}$, $q=m_1/m_2$, and  $\chi_{_{eff}}$ to identify whether there's a waveform clustering in the corners of diagram \ref{}, or rather the dataset is distributed uniformly in the $\rho_{_{opt}}$-$\alpha$ plane.


Let us begin by representing the matched filtering results of all waveforms in the $\rho_{_{opt}}$-$\alpha$ plane. The lower bound is drawn at $\alpha=0.65$ and the upper bound at $\alpha=0.80$

In what follows, histograms will be used to count where "red" and "green" crosses lie in other dimensions. First, consider histograms for the amplitude weighted frequency and duration.

Notice how transitioning from the whole dataset(left) to only above threshold waveforms(right) does two different things: It significantly reduces the tall green bar in figure \ref{}  and its neighboring bars. In addition, in figure \ref{}, we see how most green bars disappear around the 3000Hz value in the weighted frequency histogram. Combining both plots, we can tell that the lower green region in figure \ref{} contains many short waveforms with high average frequency.

Moreover, the red samples tell us how the monochromatic template model struggles to get more than 65\% of the optimal SNR for waveforms longer than 30 milliseconds. 


\newpage 

With regards to the parameters found for the best matching monochromatic template on each waveform of the catalog, we can use the histograms for the quantities  $\beta$ and $\gamma_{wei}$

Where the closer to 1.0, the better recovery of the signal duration and frequency one gets. Some waveforms in the green region recover the duration and weighted frequency well, but many green bars disappear as we go above the threshold. As previously seen, the red bars mainly belong to long waveforms, for which the monochromatic template performs very poorly recovering its length, regardless of whether the right weighted frequency was properly recovered, as the red bars seem very spread out in the $\gamma_{wei}$ histogram. 

\newpage

Let us now take a look at physical observables like the system's total mass, mass ratio, and effective spin $\chi_{eff}$.

\label{adelhist}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Counting the waveforms lying in the region where $\delta>1.6$, one can see that the green bars present in the whole dataset(left) disappear in the above threshold dataset(right). Such a set of signals can be identified as short high-frequency signals that belong to heavy systems. 

\begin{figure}[hbt!]

\label{aqhist}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The waveform dataset is dominated by equal mass waveforms, so by looking at the few waveform samples with high mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2>1.6$, one can see that the green bars survive the threshold cut, which means they lie in the upper right region of plot \ref{}, making them good candidates for detection.
 

\newpage

Finally, spinning BNS systems, i.e., $\chi_{eff}>0.2$ (see equation \ref{chieff}), are also a small subset in this catalog, as many waveforms come from non-spinning systems. Nevertheless, one can also see that the green bars survive the threshold cut, which means they lie in the upper right region of plot \ref{}, making them good candidates for detection.

\subsection*{Findings}
Overall the finite monochromatic model with constant amplitude can recover between 65-98\% of the optimal signal-noise ratio for all waveforms in the dataset. In terms of SNR recovery, the most interesting cases, as seen in the following plot, are waveforms generated by equal mass non-spinning, highly eccentric, and heavy BNS coalescences.

\newpage
Notice how the short waveforms generated by heavy BNS systems lie below the optimal SNR threshold but can be recovered well using the monochromatic model.

In addition, even though waveforms generated by highly eccentric and high mass ratio BNS systems look like promissing candidates to be modeled using the monochormatic model \ref{}, the following two plots show that such a model does not recover accurately the postmerger's duration or main frequency.

Finally, by looking at figures \ref{} and \ref{}, where brown dots represent the equal mass non-spinning binaries, one can see that the monochromatic model \ref{} can recover 70-80% of the optimal 
SNR while reproducing the postmerger's duration and frequency more accurately than in the other cases.

\section{Monochromatic models with modified amplitude envelopes}\label{zc-aenv}
One of the most characteristic features of a postmerger BNS signal is the first amplitude minimum after the merger, as seen in figure \ref{fig:9}, which appears in every waveform of the catalog. A first attempt to improve the template model could be modifying the constant amplitude of the monochromatic model with a zero-crossing amplitude envelope. 

A wide variety of known functions could model such a feature; nevertheless, this analysis will focus on: a piecewise linear function with zero crossing and a hyperbolic tangent function. Further, one could propose models that, instead of crossing the zero line, touch it tangentially and return symmetrically to its original state. The absolute value of the piecewise linear model and a squared hyperbolic tangent model would reproduce such behavior.

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item zero-crossing:
\begin{equation}\label{line}
Y0_{w, t_{min}}(t) =
\begin{cases} 
      1 &, t<t_{min}-\mathrm{\frac{width}{2}} \\
      \left( \frac{-2A}{\mathrm{width}} \right) \cdot (t- t_{min}) &, t_{min}-\mathrm{\frac{width}{2}} \leq t \leq t_{min}+\mathrm{\frac{width}{2}} \\
     -1 &, t>t_{0}+d
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{tanh}
Y1_{\epsilon, t_{min}}(t) = A \cdot \tanh (\epsilon \cdot(t-t_{min}))
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.5cm}


\item zero-touching:
\begin{equation}\label{line-abs}
Y2_{w, t_{min}}(t) = \left| Y0_{w, t_{min}}(t) \right|
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{tanh2}
Y3_{\epsilon, t_{min}}(t) = \left( Y0_{\epsilon, t_{min}}(t) \right)^2
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

Then the new templated model acquires 2-more parameters, one that controls where the zero-crossing happens and the other the width of the region where the envelope has this behavior.

\begin{equation}\label{4dim-model}
U0_{_{f,d, w, tmin}} = Y0_{_{w,t_{min}}}(t) \cdot
\begin{cases} 
      0 & t<t_{0_{opt}} \\
      A_{opt} \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_{0_{opt}}) & t_{0_{opt}} \leq t\leq t_{0_{opt}}+d \\
      0 & t>t_{0_{opt}}+d
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}


Even though template models of the form \ref{4dim-model} seem would translate the problem into a 4-dimensional search, one could keep the dimensionality low by using universal relations like [ref dietrich], which tell the location of the first minimum with respect to maximum amplitude. 

Finally, the template model can be posed as a 2D+1 when fixing the $t_{min}$ but leaving the width as a free parameter.

\begin{equation}\label{3dim-model}
U0_{_{f,d, w}} = Y0_{_{w}}(t) \cdot
\begin{cases} 
      0 & t<t_{0_{opt}} \\
      A_{opt} \cdot sin(2\pi f t + \phi_{0_{opt}}) & t_{0_{opt}} \leq t\leq t_{0_{opt}}+d \\
      0 & t>t_{0_{opt}}+d
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Finding global maxima along slices will give us all the model information; therefore, picturing such parameter space as a stack of the 2D plane will be very useful.

As seen in previous sections, equal mass and some precessing equal mass waveforms roughly show a simple oscillatory behavior with one deep amplitude minimum. For that reason, we will use models \ref{line}, \ref{line-abs}, and \ref{tanh} and compare results with the ones from the monochromatic model with a constant envelope. Precessing waveforms where the second amplitude minimum has a depth comparable to the first would require a better model.

\subsubsection*{Non-precessing Equal mass systems}
The search is performed in an 80x80x20 cubic mesh, where the frequency ranges between 2000-2500Hz, and the duration from 5ms to $1.5\cdot d_{postm}$ (see figure \ref{postm_cut}). The width ranges between 1 and 10 ms.

The search using the piecewise linear envelope model shows an SNR recovery and length marginally different from the one obtained with the monochromatic with constant amplitude model. The minimum amplitude width recovered seems to reproduce well wave shape around the minimum, but the algorithm gets more SNR when matching the tail instead of the first oscillations.

\subsubsection*{Precessing equal mass waveforms}

Precessing systems may have two types of waveforms, some with one dominant deep amplitude minimum and much small amplitude local modulations. However, also, there are cases where there is a second amplitude minimum of the order of the first one. A better model must be built for the second case, as this analysis considers the first one.

The search is also performed in an 80x80x20 cubic mesh, but the bounds are around the peak of figure \ref{BAM:0106}. The frequency ranges between 3000-3500Hz, and the duration from 5ms to $1.5\cdot d_{postm}$(see figure \ref{postm_cut}). The width ranges between 1 and 10 ms.

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

\newpage

Evidence shows that such a model would help recover a similar shape in the time domain around the minimum. However, even in cases where monochromatic with constant amplitude performed the best, i.e., SNR recovery(75\%) and length recovery up to 80\%, non of the models proposed in this section would improve a real search where the signal is not clean. Most likely, the features around the amplitude minimum could not be resolved.

Other types of waveforms, like the ones from heavy systems, with high mass ratio and eccentric, show different morphologies and would need a different amplitude evolution model as they possess different features.



\section{Impacts of amplitude and phase evolution on different postmerger  waveforms}

In general, expecting a simple monochromatic model to match the postmerger phase of any BNS waveform type sounds optimistic. Taking an existing model and adding extra features without considerably increasing its parameter space dimensionality is a very challenging task. Even simple cases like the one proposed in the previous section show that there are cases where(in the time domain)a signal seems to reproduce very well a new feature. In contrast, when used in search pipelines, the new model did not improve or even get worse results. 

Having such a complex morphology on a signal leads us to ask whether the SNR losses come from either part of the amplitude that is not quite well modeled or the misalignments caused by a poorly modeled phase evolution. With so many types of waveforms, one should not expect a single global answer that inclines towards one or the other option.

This analysis will take the phase and amplitude evolution separately, modify simple sinusoidal waves, and test which one gets the closest to a perfect model; the waveform itself.

Building both models could be done by modifying the phase of a sin wave and its amplitude separately. However, to avoid looking for better models of the postmerger amplitude and phase in state-of-the-art literature, this analysis takes the phase and amplitude of the waveform itself. Then, it uses them separately to modify a simple sinusoidal model.

\begin{itemize}

\item Amplitude


\begin{equation}\label{a-evol}
f(t) = |H(t)| \cdot \begin{cases} 
      0 &, t< t_{merg} \\
      sin(2\pi f_{_{best}}\cdot t + \phi_{opt}) &, t_{merg} \leq t \leq t_{merg} + d_{postm} \\
      0 &, t> t_{merg} + d_{postm}
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\item Phase

\begin{equation}\label{pha-evol}
g(t) = \cdot \begin{cases} 
      0 &, t< t_{merg} \\
      A \cdot sin(\phi(t)) &, t_{merg} \leq t \leq t_{merg} + d_{postm} \\
      0 &, t> t_{merg} + d_{postm}
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

To avoid the model with amplitude evolution \ref{a-evol} losing a lot of SNR due to misalignments, we first make an intermediate step to find the best frequency and phase of a constant amplitude sin while fixing the length to the length of the waveform. That represents a computationally inexpensive task as it can be formulated as a one-dimensional search.


One may explore all types of waveforms shown in figure \ref{fig:10} by examining what their SNR curves as a timeshift function look like and paying special attention to how close the peaks of each curve compare to the waveform itself.

In the case of eccentric and heavy mass waveforms, we see that a perfect amplitude evolution model would get 86\%  and 78\% of what a perfect model could get, regardless of the simple phase evolution modeling causing many misalignments in the late tail of the signal. On the other hand, equal mass systems and precessing systems would benefit much more from a very good phase evolution modeling. The inclusion of viscous hydrodynamics would not change this statement.

\subsubsection*{Tapered postmerger: Impacts of spectral leakage}

It seems plausible to discuss whether the presence of the hard cutoff introduced by the rectangular window on the issues of the postmerger cause when computing FFTs and may affect the relative height of the peaks so that the maxima switch paces. This analysis will allow a few cycles before maximum amplitude and taper the signal using a Tukey window of parameter n.

Results from tapered signals do not change the statement made for the hard cutoff case. However, instead emphasizes that phase modeling is most important for equal mass waveforms precessing waveforms, and equal mass waveforms, including viscous HD. High mass ratio waveforms are still better recovered by the amplitude evolution model; however, phase evolution gets closer.

\chapter*{Conclusions}

Modeling the postmerger BNS GW signal is a very interesting open problem. Future detectors being much more sensitive in the kHz band will require the community to have calibrated phenomenological models for the whole BNS signal for the next decade. Future improvements on current phenomenological models and advances in universal and quasi-universal relations help reduce the number of parameters a model would require since they could be inferred from the inspiral or other observations.

This thesis explored the possibility of simple modeling on every waveform in available catalogs, and it complemented those results by addressing whether amplitude or phase evolution modeling could be prioritized separately depending on the source. 
 
The initial analysis showed how the finite monochromatic model performed well on equal mass waveforms and precessing waveforms with only one amplitude minimum. It recovered from 60 to 80\% of the optimal SNR because their waveforms do not have substantial variations in the phase or phase velocity nor significant amplitude variations that could account for phaseshifts of the order of $\pi$ radians. Some sources are above the imposed threshold for detection, and implementing a model with constant amplitude but better phase evolution would get more than 80\% of the SNR while recovering all the signal cycles.

Short waveforms with weighted frequencies around 3kHz belong to systems with $\delta=\frac{M}{M_{TOV}} > 1.6$. The simple monochromatic template model recovered from 80-98\% of the optimal SNR, being a reasonably good model for them. However, most of them are not loud enough to be detectable if a source at a distance of 100MPc or more generates them. Nevertheless, closer sources like GW170817 could have detectable postmerger phases by third-generation detectors.

High mass ratio and highly eccentric waveforms are the best candidates for detection at 100MPc or more. They feature a few loud oscillations after maximum amplitude that contain 60 to 95\% followed by a lower amplitude tail. The transition from the high amplitude initial part to the low amplitude tail looks pretty challenging to recover with a Monochromatic template model because the matched filtering algorithm would not gain much SNR by considering a longer wave. A better amplitude evolution would change this, significantly improving the SNR gains while recovering the low amplitude tail much better.


%Amplitude modeling is more important for short signals generated by systems with a total gravitational mass greater than 1.6  times the maximum TOV mass and waveforms generated by systems with a high mass ratio greater than 1.6. On the other hand, signals generated by equal mass non-spinning binaries and spinning binaries with only one deep strain minimum in the time domain are already well recovered by a monochromatic signal. However, they would significantly improve if one provides a model with a much better phase evolution.
